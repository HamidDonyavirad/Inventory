## ðŸ§© Design Notes
- All serializers are based on DRFâ€™s `ModelSerializer` for simplicity and direct mapping to models.
- Optional fields (like `color`, `dimensions`, `brand` in `ProductSerializer`) allow flexibility in API.
- `RegisterSerializer` uses a custom `create` method to securely create a new user.
- `SlugRelatedField` in `ProductSerializer` makes the API more readable by showing the username instead of the raw user ID.
