## ðŸ§© Design Notes
- Each model is linked to a user to establish ownership of data.
- Choice fields are used to standardize certain fields (e.g., transaction type, order status).
- Optional fields (like color and brand) allow flexibility.
- The inventory system handles different transaction types separately (inbound, outbound, transfer).
