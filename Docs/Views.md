# üì¶ Views Documentation

This document explains the Django REST Framework (DRF) views in the project: what each does, how they work, and how they fit into the system.

---

## ‚úÖ Overview
- Built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)**.
- Uses **JWT authentication** with `rest_framework_simplejwt`.
- Each view extends from `APIView` for detailed method handling.
- Supports CRUD operations for multiple models: Product, Category, Inventory, Order, and OrderItem.
- Includes an extra endpoint to calculate live stock using aggregation.
